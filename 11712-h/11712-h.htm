<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>A man has written to the papers offering to buy five thousand
pounds of Joy Loan if the Government will get him a case of whisky.
The simple fellow does not seem to realise that if the Government
had anything as valuable as a case of whisky it would not have to
raise a loan.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The successful trans-Atlantic flight and the large number of
public-houses in Galway threaten to make prohibition in U.S.A.
nothing less than a farce.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Smoking, says a Church paper, is on the increase among boys.
Boys will be girls these days.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Smoking and bad language seem to go together, says Professor
GILBERT MURRAY. In the case of some cheap cigars we have often seen
them going together.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A bazaar has been held in Dublin for the purpose of securing a
fresh stock of wild animals for the Zoological Gardens. It is not
believed, however, that the popularity of Sinn Fein can be
seriously challenged.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Serbia," says an Italian news agency, "is purchasing large
quantities of war material and aeroplanes." It is feared, however,
that these elaborate Peace preparations may yet turn out to be
premature.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Two German machine guns, it is stated, have been placed in a
provincial library. Even this, it is thought, will not prevent Mr.
H.G. WELLS from doing what he conceives to be his duty.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Labour unrest is reported from Spitzbergen. There is also a
rumour that the Greenlanders are demanding the nationalization of
blubber and a 180-day year.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There is said to be some talk at Washington of the House of
Representatives inviting President WILSON to visit America
shortly.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Chicago Girls' Club has decided that its members shall have
nothing to do with young men. It is certainly getting to be an
effeminate habit.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>The Daily Mail</i> has presented a golden slipper for the
actress with the smallest feet. The slipper, we understand, is
quite new and has never been used on anybody.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An American gentleman is about to offer for sale his corkscrew,
or would exchange for something useful.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A very mean theft is reported from West Ealing. Not content with
stealing the loose silver a burglar is reported to have stolen the
muzzle from off the watch-dog.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The New Cross Fire Brigade have been awarded a Challenge Cup for
the quickest work. This brigade is now open to book a few orders
for fires during August, when they have several open dates.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We understand that a couple of young cheeses were kidnapped from
a Crouch Hill warehouse last week.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is a surprising fact, says a contemporary, that when LENIN
was born his parents were practically penniless. The greater
mystery is that his parents decided to keep him.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A statistical expert has estimated that if all the questions
asked by Mr. SMILLIE at the Coal Commission's sittings were placed
one before the other they would lead to nowhere.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Over one hundred posters illustrating the danger of house-flies
have been exhibited in the Enfield district. It is doubtful whether
this will have the desired effect, for it is well known that flies
cannot read.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The price of a first-class interment, says a contemporary, has
risen from &pound;3 18<i>s</i> 0<i>d</i>. to &pound;5 15<i>s</i>.
0<i>d</i>. The result is that many people have decided to try to do
without one this year.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The arrival in England of a rare mosquito is reported by the
South-Eastern Union of Scientific Societies. It seems that the
insect had worked its passage to the British Museum. We think that
a sharper look-out should be kept on mosquitoes arriving at our
ports.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A painful episode is reported from Yarmouth. It appears that a
visitor, desirous of taking home a souvenir of his holiday,
thoughtlessly filled a bottle with sea water at low tide, with the
result that just before high tide the bottle burst, inflicting
serious injuries on the passengers in the railway carriage in which
he was travelling.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Out of nine applicants for the post of Language Master at a
well-known Public school, eight were proficient in at least five
languages. However, as the ninth man proved to be an
ex-Sergeant-Major, the eight immediately retired in his favour.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We now hear that the question regarding the possession of
Kladizatiffagtaliofatoffka, in Poland, which has caused so much of
the delay at the Peace Conference, has been satisfactorily settled.
The four Big Powers are to have a couple of syllables each and the
remaining three will be raffled for.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>On account of the large number of robberies of safes that have
taken place in London during the last few weeks it is possible that
an effort will shortly be made to do away with these cumbersome
articles in order to stamp out the epidemic.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The bacteriologist of the Oyster Merchants' and Planters'
Association claims to have discovered a means of purifying polluted
mussels. To ascertain if a mussel requires to be purified examine
the whites of its eyes.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Newspapers have appeared again in Buenos Ayres. No other
troubles are anticipated.</p>

<h3>GOING TO THE BANK.</h3>
<p>She thought she had got a bargain. It was only marked "20/-,"
and would have been double the price at any of the West-end places.
So she whipped out her Japanese note-case, paid for it, and carried
it off like a whirlwind lest the shopman should find he had made a
mistake.</p>
<p>But it was she who had made a mistake, and she broke the news to
me at breakfast on the following morning.</p>
<p>Two of her one-pound notes (or, to be exact, <i>my</i> one pound
notes) must have stuck together. She had paid the West-end price
after all.</p>
<p>Then, instead of blaming her own carelessness, as I should have
done, what must she do but attack Mr. LLOYD GEORGE?</p>
<p>"It's all his fault, this horrid dirty paper-money... Spreading
infection wherever it goes!"</p>
<p>It devolved upon me to defend the Government, which I did with
some heat, drawing forth another one-pound note casually, as though
I were made of them, and flourishing it in my hand.</p>
<p>"And anyway," I argued, "Mr. LLOYD GEORGE is not to blame. The
note does not bear his signature, but that of Sir JOHN BRADBURY.
And a fine bold signature it is&mdash;why, it's dirt-cheap for the
lesson in handwriting alone."</p>
<p>She did not appreciate that, because hers is a small scrabbed
writing. But I continued mercilessly&mdash;</p>
<p>"I bet he doesn't bite <i>his</i> lips when he's signing his
name."</p>
<p>"Extremely bad writing, I should call it," she retorted. "Look,
you cannot tell where the '<i>u</i>' ends and the '<i>r</i>'
begins."</p>
<p>"But aside from that," I resumed (I was very proud of this
expression, having picked it up from President WILSON)&mdash;"aside
from that, turn the note over, feast your eyes on the picture of
the Houses of Parliament. It too is thrown in for nothing. This at
least ought to appeal to you, with your enthusiasm for Gothic
architecture."</p>
<p>If looks could annihilate, that would have been my last boiled
egg.</p>
<p>"You think yourself very clever," she said, "and you are
supposed to understand all about money matters. Surely you know of
a bank where I can take these wretched notes and get gold instead,
the good old English gold that was worth its face-value all the
world over?"</p>
<p>I did not know she could be so eloquent. I rose and went to the
window. It was a noble morning.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said after a little reflection, "put on your best hat
and collect your paper-money. But try and pack it all into the
kit-bag if you possibly can." (She winced a little.) "I know a bank
where you will be able to get all the gold you want...."</p>
<hr />
<p>Shoulder to shoulder we fought the good fight for the
motor-bus.</p>
<p>"Two to the Bank," I gasped.</p>
<p>But it was at Charing Cross station I made her descend. She
looked extraordinarily mystified, and I explained that the Bank's
country branches are the only ones where gold is still to be
had.</p>
<hr />
<p>She and an empty milk-can and I were all that got out at the
little station in the hills. However, a cuckoo introduced himself
boldly by name. He seemed so near he might have been in the
booking-office. But the booking-office was deserted.</p>
<p>"There can't possibly be a bank in this out-of-the-world place,"
she protested.</p>
<p>"Patience," I replied, leading her down a steep path between
high thick hedges to a small gateway. Through this we went, and I
heard her draw in her breath.</p>
<p>From our feet, as it seemed, up to the blue sky itself, one
golden glowing bank of buttercups and cowslips... and cowslips. It
was almost like trying to gaze at the noonday sun.</p>
<p>"There," I crowed, "you will be able to get all the gold you
want. Did I not say, 'I know a bank'?"</p>
<p>She did a curious thing. She put her arms round my neck and
kissed me.</p>
<p>"Dear old Mr. Sententious," said she, "did you think you could
take <i>me</i> in? I knew my <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i> by
heart while you were still discovering 'THE-HOG-IS-IN-THE-PIT'!"
And she sang quite softly:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,</p>
<p>Where oxlips&mdash;"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Though I was very angry at the way she had deceived me, I must
admit that her voice was not unpleasing.</p>
<hr />
<h4>In a Good Cause.</h4>
<p>The National Baby Week Council, which for many years has done
admirable work in promoting the Welfare of Infancy and Motherhood,
is to hold its annual "Week" from July 1st to 7th. Among other
London celebrations a Conference will be held at Kingsway Hall,
under the Presidency of Dr. ADDISON, on the Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday. Applications for admission (one guinea, to include proofs
of papers to be read and a copy of the Report; or ten shillings,
without printed matter) should be addressed to Miss HALFORD,
Secretary, National Association for the Prevention of Infant
Mortality, 4 and 5 Tavistock Square, W.C.1.</p>

<h2>A TANGLED TRIANGLE.</h2>
<p>The P&acirc;tisserie Delarue et Salon de Consommations is
situated just on the edge of Europe. Being a place of extreme
military importance I dare not indicate its position with greater
exactitude, but may go so far as to say that it can be found by
stepping off the boat, crossing the bridge and then inquiring of
the Military Police. Its importance is due to the quality of its
<i>cr&egrave;me &eacute;clairs</i>, which attract the gilded Staff
in such large numbers that the interior is usually suffused like an
Eastern sunset with a rich glow of red tabs and gilt braid. Within
its walls junior subalterns, now, alas, a rapidly diminishing
species, dally with insidious ices until their immature moustaches
are pendulous with lemon-flavoured icicles and their hair is
whitened with sugared rime.</p>
<p>There it was that Frederick discovered Percival feebly and
mournfully pecking at a vanilla ice.</p>
<p>"Greeting, old Spartan," said he. "Training for the Murman
coast?"</p>
<p>"Would that I were!" replied Percival. "I'm refrigerating my
sorrows. I've tried to drown them, but they float; so I'm by way of
freezing them under."</p>
<p>"Poor Perce!" murmured Frederick. "I suppose it's Cox
again?"</p>
<p>"<i>Au contraire</i>, I'm <i>his</i> sorrow. My present trouble
is that I've got to find a wife."</p>
<p>"Nothin' easier, old thing. Your photo in the illustrated
papers, with appropriate letterpress&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You misunderstand me," interrupted Percival. "It's someone
else's wife I've got to find. <i>&Eacute;coutez</i>. Teddy Roker
has got permission for his wife to visit him out here. He's
expecting her by this afternoon's boat and has got a billet fixed
up all right, but he's been suddenly rushed away on a court-martial
case, so he's asked me to meet her, and I've never seen her
before."</p>
<p>"But didn't he give you the specifications&mdash;kind of
descriptive return?"</p>
<p>"That's just it!" groaned Percival. "He was only married last
leave, and his description goes like a Shakspearean sonnet. I
gather that I've got to look out for a combination of
<i>Titania</i>, GLADYS COOPER and HELEN OF TROY. I tried to nail
him down to externals, but he only went off into another
rhapsody.</p>
<p>"'What does she wear?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'Wear?' said he dreamily. 'Oh! beautifully draped garments
nebulous as summer clouds and filmy as gossamer webs. Nothing
really definite.'</p>
<p>"'That sounds probable enough, as the present fashions go,'"
said I.</p>
<p>"Seems to me," said Frederick, "that this is a case to refer to
higher authority. The sleuth-hound instinct of one Frederick is
indicated. Having absorbed the available data I will e'en amble
round myself to assist you."</p>
<p>"There speaks my stout-hearted haricot!" said Percival. "But be
careful. Teddy won't like it if he gets the wrong wife. He made a
point of that. So in case we miss each other your instructions are
briefly these: you will meet what you honestly think to be Mrs.
Roker outside the Customs House, explain Teddy's absence, take her
to his rooms at 10 <i>bis</i>, Rue Dufay, make her comfortable and
report to me here at 6.15."</p>
<p>Punctually at 6.15 they met again in the P&acirc;tisserie
Delarue. Both were radiant.</p>
<p>"'Tis done!" said Percival proudly; "and without the assistance
of the puissant Frederick. At 5.0 o'clock I was outside the Customs
House and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id=
"page497"></a>[pg 497]</span> saw her looking round with an anxious
eye. 'Mrs. Roker, I believe?' said I. She confessed right away, so
I rattled her off in a cab to 10 <i>bis</i>, Rue Dufay, and left
her there nibblin' biscuits and drinkin' tea as happy as a
flapper."</p>
<p>"Percival," replied Frederick slowly, "for sheer imbecility you
have surpassed yourself. I myself met Mrs. Roker outside the
Customs House at 5.30, being detained <i>en route</i>. I took her
to 10 <i>bis</i>, Rue Dufay, where at the present moment she is
partaking of coffee and chocolate caramels. Shortly, no doubt, she
will discover the spurious female that you have decoyed thither and
the First Act of a triangle drama will be rung up."</p>
<p>"By Jazz," exclaimed Percival, "I'd stake my gratuity on the
genuineness of my Mrs. Roker. She knows Teddy's favourite breakfast
food."</p>
<p>"No," said Frederick decidedly, "mine is the only authentic
article. All others are imitations. She knows dearest Edward's size
in gloves."</p>
<p>"Well, we can't both be right."</p>
<p>"Did Teddy say anything about expecting <i>two</i> wives?" asked
Frederick hopefully.</p>
<p>"Idiot!" said Percival. "As I see the situation, one of
us&mdash;presumably you&mdash;will presently be the central figure
in a court-martial or police court on a charge of abducting an
innocent female. The remaining reels in the film will be devoted to
Teddy chasing you with a 5&middot;9 howitzer for jeopardizing his
connubial happiness. But these unhappy concluding incidents may be
averted if you return the wrongful lady to her rightful owner
before Teddy gets back. So we'll take the necessary action
immediately."</p>
<p>"But which one are we going to discard if they both claim to be
the genuine Mrs. R.? Hadn't we better wait for Teddy? He'd be
almost sure to be able to decide."</p>
<p>"You make me tired. It's got to be settled before he comes
back."</p>
<p>It was a brace of dejected subalterns that wended their way to
10 <i>bis</i>, Rue Dufay. Percival knocked at the door of the
drawing-room and in response to an invitation they entered. A
pretty and extremely composed young lady greeted them.</p>
<p>"<i>My</i> wife!" said Percival and Frederick
simultaneously.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said the lady with dignity; "the only husband I
possess at present is Mr. Roker."</p>
<p>"What I mean to say is," explained Percival lamely, "that you
are the wife of Mr. Roker that I met at the Customs&mdash;I mean,
Mr. Roker's wife that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Me too!" broke in Frederick.</p>
<p>"Well, that's easily explained," said the lady, addressing
Percival. "After you had kindly escorted me here I suddenly
remembered that I had left my keys at the Customs House. Feeling
confident of finding my way about I returned for them. On emerging
I was claimed by your fascinating friend who is at this moment
engaged in winding up his monocle [Frederick guiltily stowed it
away in his fob pocket]. He seemed so delighted at having
discovered me that I hadn't the heart to explain that I'd been
found before. Of course I'm excessively grateful to both of
you&mdash;Oh, here's dear old Teddy at last!"</p>
<p>During the scene of rapturous greeting that followed Frederick
showed that he indeed had his moments of inspiration.</p>
<p>"What about a vanilla ice at the P&acirc;tisserie Delarue, old
bean?" said he to Percival.</p>
<p>And, unnoticed by the happy couple, they stole silently
away.</p>

<h3>A TUBE NIGHTMARE.</h3>
<p>Have you ever dreamed a dream of a terrible tube journey, in
which every one of the appalling things which might happen does
actually occur? I dreamed one last night.</p>
<p>The journey began with a disaster. On reaching the
booking-office window I could not find any money, and it was only
when the waiting crowd behind me, which had mounted to hundreds,
was becoming offensively hostile that I succeeded in producing a
five-pound note.</p>
<p>The booking-clerk took her own time to count out the change, and
on leaving the window I found four policemen struggling to keep
back an infuriated mob of people, all shrieking imprecations and
asking for my blood.</p>
<p>There was but one thing for it&mdash;to get to a train before
this angry horde could secure its tickets; so I made a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>[pg 499]</span> wild
dash for the moving-staircase, shedding Bradburys <i>en route</i>
like a paper-chase.</p>
<p>As I rushed past the ticket-puncher she made a vicious lunge at
my out-stretched hand with an enormous pair of pincers, missing the
ticket and partially amputating my thumb.</p>
<p>As I have always expected to do, but have never yet done, I
missed my footing at the top of the escalator, and my desire to
outstrip my enemies was realised beyond my wildest hopes as I
crashed, by a series of petrifying somersaults, down the entire
flight, to be belched forth like a sausage from a machine at the
bottom.</p>
<p>Tattered, torn and in unspeakable agony I picked myself up and
found my steering-gear so damaged that I could only move sideways,
crab-fashion, and in this manner I crawled on to the platform just
as a train was beginning its exit.</p>
<p>I make a leap for it. The gates crash to! Am I inside them or
out? Neither. I am pinned there with the first half of my body
struggling inside the car while the second half protrudes over the
fast-receding platform.</p>
<p>I remember how in my agony it flashed across my mind that I
would never again slay a wasp with my fork.</p>
<p>I must have been pulled into the car just in time to stop the
tunnel (which is a dreadfully close fit) from bisecting me, for the
next thing I remember was being dropped into a corner seat and
severely admonished by the guard for getting into the train whilst
it was in motion.</p>
<p>I was now a quivering and shapeless mass; nobody pitied me,
nobody helped me, so loathsome a spectacle did I present.</p>
<p>Of course the train passed my station, and at the next I was
thrown out like a mail-bag, to be trodden on by massed formations
of travellers fighting to enter and leave the car by the same door
at the same time.</p>
<p>When the multitudes had dispersed and I was alone, by superhuman
efforts I contrived to wriggle on my stomach to the foot of the
ascending stairway, but not having sufficient strength to wriggle
off on arrival at the top, my long-dreaded horror of being sucked
under the barrier, where moving stairways disappear, was
realised.</p>
<p>By now immune to pain, I regarded the next process (akin to
being passed through a mangle) as child's play. To my amazement,
after a few minutes amongst giant cog-wheels, I again found the
light on the down-going staircase, which precipitated me to the
spot from which I had started.</p>
<p>Having thrice performed this revolution, by which time I was as
flat as a pancake, I was eventually scraped off by a porter and
upbraided for joy-riding.</p>
<p>Finding that those rebukes left me unmoved, for I was
practically lifeless, certainly boneless, and, to their horror,
ticketless, they folded me up and put me in a drawer pending the
arrival of the police.</p>
<p>I was still there when the dream mercifully stopped.</p>

<h2>CROSS COUNTRY.</h2>
<p>A Commander in the Senior Service is the man who gets things
done; and long experience has formulated for him a golden rule: "If
you want to get things done you must <i>see</i> them done." This
laudable maxim applies in a lesser degree to all his subordinates,
right down to the newly-joined boy, who can't very well help seeing
<i>some</i> things done, unless he makes a habit of working with
his eyes shut&mdash;a practice which does not appeal particularly
to P.O.'s.</p>
<p>The Commander of His Majesty's Battleship <i>Ermyntrude</i> is
far from being an exception to the rule; he is a martyr to it. So
are his officers. In their enthusiasm they have let the rule run
riot. You will soon see that for yourself.</p>
<p>The idea germinated in the practical head of the gunner. It
pushed its way into the upper air under the plain cap of the A.P.
It budded under the (slighted tilted) head-dress of Number One, and
blossomed forth into a full-blown project under the gilded
oak-leaves that thatch the Bloke.</p>
<p>He said, "The ship's company will run across country."</p>
<p>The ship's company girded up its loins and awaited further
orders.</p>
<p>The course was decided upon. It ran from the signalling station
on the south of the island straight to the town on the north. There
was no possibility of making a mistake, because you could see the
semaphore from anywhere, and you would know when you got to the
town because the road stopped there. The various divisions of the
ship were to compete against each other. If you came in first you
were to be given a ticket numbered "one"; if second, a ticket
numbered "two," and so on; and the division which had the smallest
total of pips at the end would be the winner.</p>
<p>At 8.15 the ship's pinnace landed the gunner on the town jetty
at the north end of the island. He had come to deal with the
competitors when they arrived at the winning-post. He had brought
with him the bo'sun and the carpenter, his own mate, the bo'sun's
mate and the carpenter's mate, four P.O.'s, the sergeant of
Marines, a few leading stokers and half-a-dozen hands; fifty
fathoms of hawser-laid four-inch white rope; six stout stakes
(ash); bags, canvas, twelve (one to collect the tickets earned by
each division); and one thousand eight hundred tickets, numbered
from one to one thousand eight hundred. (There were only six
hundred and fifty runners, but it is well to be on the safe
side.)</p>
<p>He dug his stakes into the ground in a V-shaped formation just
beyond the place where the road ended and almost opposite the first
cottage. Further north he posted his canvas bags, which he fixed at
a convenient height above the ground by depending them from the
necks of his subordinates. He then rigged his rope around the
stakes in such a way that the runners, entering the wide end of the
V, would be shepherded one by one through a narrow aperture at the
bottom, thus avoiding all suspicion of overcrowding in giving out
the tickets. He explained his plan of campaign to his party and
took up his post at the foot of the V.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he done so when the A.P. appeared upon the scene.
He had brought with him a few friends&mdash;a couple of subs, two
or three senior snotties and the Captain's secretary, a brace of
stewards with the luncheon baskets, and the cutter's crew, who
carried between them two large trellis-work screens which the
carpenter had knocked up for him.</p>
<p>He passed the time of day with the gunner, marched fifty yards
further down towards the starting-point and had his screens
deposited in the middle of the road, in such a way that several
could enter one end of the enclosure they formed, but only one at a
time could go out at the other; this, he explained, would enable
the men to pass the winning-post in single file. He then lit a
cigarette and took his stand at the narrow end, producing from his
pocket seven hundred and fifty neat red tickets (numbered from one
to seven hundred and fifty) which the chief writer had made out for
him the night before.</p>
<p>At 8.45 Number One arrived. To help him he had brought a couple
of watch-keepers, a surgeon, three engineers, a naval instructor
and the captain of Marines. He only paused to borrow one side of
the gunner's V and all but forty of the A.P.'s tickets, and passed
on down the road. When he had reached a suitable point about a
hundred yards south of the A.P. he had the purloined rope stretched
slantwise, in such a way that the only means of passing it was a
little passage a yard wide between the rope and the ditch on the
right of the road. A little nearer still to the starting-point he
had a large placard erected with the words "Keep to the Right"
painted on it.</p>
<p>Punctually at 9.0 the Commander arrived with a piece of string
and the P.M.O. They took up their stand one on each side of the
road opposite the placard. The Bloke produced a small gold pencil,
but, as he had forgotten to bring any paper, he commandeered the
placard and began feverishly to write down all the numbers he could
think of from one to six hundred and fifty.</p>
<p>You are no doubt anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Owner at
9.15. Well, I'm afraid I must disappoint you. Still, although he
did not come in person, yet he made his presence felt, as every
good skipper should. At 9.15, as the ship's company were lining up
for the start by the semaphore, he made the signal from the
ship:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sailing at 13.30. Return immediately."</p>

<h3>A CRUSADER.</h3>
<p>One hears sometimes of pure altruists, but on analysing their
purity an alloy is perceptible. Although their work is for others,
an element of personal gratification is present.</p>
<p>Personal gratification or self-indulgence is of course
inevitable; as it can even enter into grief and pain; but now and
then it is reduced to a minimum: as, I hold, in the latest
activities for her fellow-creatures in which my friend Mrs. Delta
has embarked.</p>
<p>During the War Mrs. Delta was indefatigable (I am not often sure
of my words, but I use this without a tremor of misgiving) in
promoting charities and collecting money to sustain them. At no
time of day was it safe to meet her, for you had to stand and
deliver. There were no privations due to the War which she was not
out to mollify or remove, and her ingenuity in discovering worthy
objects was uncanny.</p>
<p>As, however, War was raging and most people are, underneath,
kinder than not, she escaped very severe criticism and amassed some
good round sums. And, since all her various Funds had committees
and meetings and minutes, Mrs. Delta, although that may have been
only the least among her motives, was the recipient of certain
expressions of gratitude. Organised charity cannot elude votes of
thanks.</p>
<p>But that Mrs. Delta likes work for work's sake, apart altogether
from honeyed praises, is now beyond question, for the campaign she
has just inaugurated is unlikely to yield them.</p>
<p>"You must," she said to me yesterday, "give me something for my
new scheme."</p>
<p>"I hope I shall have enough strength of mind not to; but what is
it?"</p>
<p>"You have noticed in what a dreadful state so many of the shop
windows in London now are?" she asked.</p>
<p>"The iniquitous prices of the goods?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no; I didn't mean that. I mean the dropped letters. Where
they have glass letters stuck on, you know, and some have gone.
Surely you must have noticed?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course," I replied; "but I thought the shop-keepers
were too lazy or careless to bother. The War has increased
carelessness, you know."</p>
<p>"No, it isn't that," she said. "The poor fellows are so
understaffed and overworked that they can't find time. My idea is
to raise a fund so that it can be done for them. My heart aches.
Only this morning I saw a barber's with &nbsp;&nbsp;ASH AND
&nbsp;&nbsp;RUSH UP on it; and a confectioner's"&mdash;she referred
to her notebook&mdash;"with ICE &nbsp;&nbsp;REAMS, and an
undertaker's with PINKING &nbsp;&nbsp;ONE &nbsp;&nbsp;ERE."</p>
<p>"What is pinking?" I asked. "I always wanted to know."</p>
<p>"And," she continued, again consulting her book, "a
tobacconist's with BEST &nbsp;&nbsp;OLDEN
VIRGIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, and a dentist's with
PA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LESS EXTRACTION. Something really must be
done. Don't you agree?"</p>
<p>I murmured that there were other abuses that were possibly more
in need of immediate redress, but Mrs. Delta again turned to her
book.</p>
<p>"And a dairyman with FAMILIES
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIE&nbsp;&nbsp;,
and a stationer's with &nbsp;&nbsp;LUE &nbsp;&nbsp;LACK INK. Isn't
it distressing?&mdash;and so bad for growing children to see so
much slovenliness. And what can foreigners think of us? The
Americans, for instance, who are always so spick and span,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>The means of rescue came to me in the shape, of a vast monster
on wheels, bright with yellow and scarlet, thundering over the
road. "That's my bus," I said, and ran.</p>

<h3>WHY DRAG IN MRS. SIDDONS?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Nothing annoys me more than the assumption
that wit, learning, fancy, etc., were the monopoly of the past. For
example, a correspondent of one of our leading dailies has been
trotting out Mrs. SIDDONS' use of blank verse in familiar
conversation, and quoting from LOCKHART:&mdash;</p>
<p>"John Kemble's most familiar table-talk often flowed into blank
verse; and so indeed did his sister's [Mrs. Siddons']. Scott (who
was a capital mimic) often repeated her tragic exclamation to a
foot-boy during a dinner at Ashestiel&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'You 've brought me water, boy,&mdash;I asked for beer!'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another time, dining with a Provost of Edinburgh, she
ejaculated, in answer to her host's apology for his <i>pi&egrave;ce
de r&eacute;sistance</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Beef cannot be too salt for me, my lord.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all very well, but just as good blank verse is commonly
used by eminent men and women to-day; indeed some of them excel in
impromptu rhymes. Thus in Mr. HAROLD WESTMORELAND'S interesting
volume, <i>Eavesdroppings</i>, there is this charming story of the
first meeting of Madame CLARA BUTT and Miss CARRIE TUBB. They were
introduced at a garden-party at Fulham, and Mr. WESTMORELAND
overheard the memorable quatrain in which Madame CLARA BUTT greeted
her sister-artist:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"In our names we 're alike</p>
<p class="i2">But in minstrelsy&mdash;ah no!</p>
<p>For I'm a contralto</p>
<p class="i2">And you're a soprano."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To the same veracious chronicler I am indebted for a specimen of
the impromptus which Lord READING frequently throws off, to the
delight of his friends. Mr. WESTMORELAND was having a pair of boots
tried on at a famous Jermyn Street bootmaker's when Lord BEADING
was undergoing a similar ordeal, and electrified the courteous
assistant by observing:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The right-foot boot to me seems rather tight;</p>
<p>The left, <i>per contra</i>, feels exactly right."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But perhaps the finest exponent of the art is a famous General,
whose <i>obiter dicta</i> in verse are innumerable. I have only
space to quote one, spoken to a soldier with whom he had shaken
hands:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"You are the proudest man in France,</p>
<p class="i2">Or at any rate in Flanders,</p>
<p>For you've shaken hands, in a great advance,</p>
<p class="i2">With the greatest of Corps Commanders."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Surely in the light of these examples, which might be
indefinitely multiplied, there is no need for the present to fear
comparison with the past in the sphere of conversational verse?</p>
<p>I am, dear Mr. Punch,</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>NOSTRI TEMPORIS LAUDATOR.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<p class="center">"THE CINDERELLA MAN."</p>
<p>The importation of theatrical sweet-stuff from America is of
course a growing industry. The latest consignment, <i>The
Cinderella Man</i>, first arrived in this country in the form of a
novel, and the difficulty it offered was that the struggling hero,
<i>Anthony Quintard</i>, whose fate depended, in the absence of
common-sense, on his winning a ten thousand dollar prize for an
opera libretto, seemed to me, from samples of his work exhibited,
to be an unlikely competitor. But I must say that when at the play
I saw our Mr. NARES in his garret sucking at his pipe in that
masterful manner and modifying what might so easily have been a too
sticky situation with a charmingly light touch, I began to think
better of <i>Anthony's</i> chances and therefore necessarily of Mr.
EDWARD CHILDS CARPENTER'S general idea. For the author obviously
may claim the credit of this reading, even if I harbour an
obstinate private suspicion that it was only by a very deliberate
and steadfast determination on the part of Mr. NARES as hero and
Mr. HOLMAN CLARK as matchmaker that this particular reading
prevailed.</p>
<p>Mr. CARPENTER doesn't believe in mystifications. He explains
everything with the completest candour in his first Act, from which
you gather that a millionaire's daughter, returning from Paris to
the immense stuffy New York mansion, is desperately lonely, and has
also cut herself free from an unsatisfactory affair of the heart;
that a young poet, a friend of the millionaire's sentimental
lawyer, is also lonely, living like <i>Cinderella</i> (isn't this
wrong?) in an attic next-door, proud as poor; that another friend
of the millionaire has offered a prize for a libretto. Having thus
put the rabbit, the bird-cage and the flowerpot into the hat in
front of you he proceeds in a leisurely manner to take them out
again.</p>

</a>
<p>A Fairy Godmother (Miss REN&Eacute;E KELLY) reduced to tears by
the unsusceptibility of her Godchild (MR. OWEN NARES).</p>
</div>
<p>The young millionairess, posing as a poor "companion," visits
the starveling poet <i>vi&acirc;</i> the snow-covered roof and the
attic window, bringing food, stoves, coverlets, wool to mend his
socks and ideas to mend his opera. Naturally here were
opportunities of unlimited business, during which <i>Marjorie</i>
(Miss REN&Eacute;E KELLY) looked perfectly sweet, as I heard more
than one ardent young lady declare to approving lieutenants.</p>
<p>Miss KELLY has indeed all the air of a heroine of honeyed
romance. In particular she played one episode, the trying over of a
new song, in a winningly natural manner. I found the way in which
she flapped her eyelids a subject of puzzled study. I have not
observed that maidens in real life indulge in these calisthenics.
This is perhaps as well; they are evidently very deadly. Within a
fortnight of their being brought into action poet <i>Quintard</i>
is in the <i>Kamerad</i> stage. Not <i>Anne Whitfield</i> herself
exhibits more explicitly the urgency of the life force, the will to
wed.</p>
<p>Mr. OWEN NARES, who has a following more than sufficient to
justify his recent assumption of management, gave a very attractive
and indeed, within the limits imposed by the piece, a distinguished
performance as the proud and hungry poet. An extreme naturalness of
pose and intonation, without over-stresses or affectations,
characterised this agreeable study. Mr. HOLMAN CLARK, that finished
actor in the bland manner, very adroitly, as I have hinted, settled
the mood of the piece and made the good appear the better line and
the ordinary line good. Mr. SYDNEY VALENTINE had a Valentine part
ready made. It would take more than an indisposition, which he
pluckily ignored, to put him off his stroke. Mr. TOM REYNOLDS was
effective as a maudlin serving-man who had once butled a real
gentleman and could never forget it. Miss ANNIE ESMOND gave a
depressingly clever rendering of a quite unbelievably appalling
landlady.</p>
<p>Altogether a pleasant wholesome evening's entertainment. Young
men and maidens of our day needn't hesitate to take their
parents.</p>
<p class="center">"ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONS."</p>
<p>There is much more of the substance of wit and truth in Mr. EDEN
PHILLPOTTS' "Devon comedy" at the Kingsway. The <i>St. George</i>
of the title is not the Cappadocian, but that somewhat irreverent
Father in God, <i>St. George Loftus</i>, Bishop of Exeter; the
dragons are two quite unsuitable suitors for the hands of
<i>Monica</i> and <i>Eva</i> (daughters of his dull old friend,
<i>Lord Sampford</i>), who don't believe in class distinctions.
<i>Monica's</i> young man is the son of a yeoman farmer,
personable, certainly, on horseback and of a blood older than the
<i>Sampfords'</i>, but an essential resilient, and altogether
impossible when playing the concertina or after mixing his drinks
(or both). <i>Eva's</i> follower is a brilliant raw young man from
Glasgow, recently ordained, with professional ambitions as
pronounced as his accent.</p>
<p>The parents try the now exploded method of direct opposition.
<i>St. George's</i> weapons are smooth words and a heart chokefull
of guile. Does his god-daughter <i>Monica</i> want to elope with
her yeoman? By all means let love have his sacred way. But his
lordship will contrive in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a strayed and
bogged fisherman to be at Stonelands Farm before the young couple
arrive <i>en route</i> for London and the registry-office, and he
will see to it that <i>Monica</i> learns what the daily life of a
working farmer is like, and what the beer (or bad champagne for
festal occasions) and rabbit pie in the kitchen; with sudden frank
explanations as to the imminence of the crisis in the interesting
condition of <i>Snowdrop</i> the Alderney; what, too, is the
Stonelands' notion of music and the dance, with Teddy's braying
concertina and cousin Unity's quavering treble and the ragged bass
and candid speech of old <i>Caunter</i>, the head man.... So much
for <i>Monica</i>.</p>
<p>And <i>Eva</i> thinks she wants to tie herself to this crude
Glaswegian. Well, here it will be best to insinuate to the young
man how unfortunate it is that the vacant chaplaincy to the Bishop
of Exeter is designed for a celibate, and to the young woman that
to marry so brilliant (and ingenuous) a youth is to hang a
millstone round his neck. For, after all, muses the prelate,
revealing dreadful depths of low cunning and perfidy, it's easier
to change a chaplain than a husband.</p>
<p>A thoroughly amusing affair. Of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page507" id="page507"></a>[pg 507]</span> course Mr. PHILLPOTTS
shirks his problem, <i>Teddy Copplestone</i> need not have been a
bounder (the odds indeed were against it), nor need his cigars, his
champagne or his music have been so bad. But then we should have
missed a diverting piece of fun and have been saddled with a solemn
problem-play unsuited to the (alleged) gaiety of the hour.</p>
<p>The general level of the playing was high, and, after a somewhat
nervous opening (and perhaps just a few affectations of the
fourth-wall school), the piece swung into a pleasant rhythm.</p>
<p>Mr. ERNEST THESIGER interprets with consummate ability Mr.
PHILLPOTTS' amusing and original creation, this puss-in-gaiters
Machiavelli, <i>St. George Exon</i>. Miss LILLAH MCCARTHY
(<i>Monica</i>), in the familiar <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of beauty in
revolt, had an easy task, which she fulfilled very agreeably. Miss
ALBANESI (<i>Eva</i>) put brains and fire and (not at all a
negligible gift of the gods) precise enunciation into her work. Mr.
FEWLASS LLEWELLYN and Miss MARY BROUGH were quite delightful as old
<i>Copplestone</i> and his wife. Mr. CLAUDE KING as <i>Teddy
Copplestone</i> had perhaps the most difficult task, a part that by
no means played itself, but needed a sustained skill, duly
forthcoming. But I think the performance that pleased me most was
that of Miss EVELYN WALSH HALL, a name new to me, in the small part
of <i>Unity Copplestone</i>, played with a directness and sincerity
which was quite distinguished.</p>
<p>Let me add that the flapping of eyelids (to which I have
referred in my remarks on <i>The Cinderella Man</i>) is here also a
feature. One member of the cast (of my own sex, too) gave a display
of virtuosity in this <i>genre</i> which was technically
superb.</p>
<p>Two insignificant details of management caused me some
amusement. The solemn clang of a gong presaging doom as dire as
OEDIPUS'S (and incidentally inaudible to cigarette smokers in the
foyer) gives notice of the resumption of the play, while at the end
of the Acts the curtain flutters up and down at a feverish pace as
if the idea was to get in as many "calls" as possible before the
applause stops. Are we as guileless as all that, I wonder? And,
anyway, no such manoeuvre was necessary. The applause was hearty,
the laughter spontaneous, and anybody who cares for plays made and
played with brains should go and see this engaging piece.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
Clerks.)</i></p>
<p><i>Jinny the Carrier</i> (HEINEMANN) was, as Mr. ZANGWILL lets
us know in a felicitous epistle-dedicatory to an evidently charming
lady, designed as a "bland" and leisurely book, free from any trace
of war's horrors or modern perplexities, the sort you could read
comfortably with a sore throat on you. I think if I had not been in
such rude health I might have managed the five hundred and eighty
odd close-set pages without getting just a little tired of his
worthy Essex peasants of the time of the great Hyde Park
Exhibition. <i>Jinny</i> herself is a perfect darling, of real wit
and character, and her business as the local carrier gives a
plausible machinery for the introduction of an enormous number, a
truly Dickensian profusion, of subsidiary characters. <i>Jinny</i>
indeed is above criticism, but the trouble with many, indeed with
most, of the others, seemed to me to be their exaggerated
sprightliness of speech, just a little too clever to be credible
and not quite amusing enough to be palatable in large doses. To me
the real pleasure of the book comes from the author's craftsmanlike
use of words and the humour and imagination of his descriptions and
asides. But if I may be humbly candid beyond the custom of my trade
I must confess to an uncomfortable impression that sounder
qualities in the reviewer would have discovered greater qualities
in the work.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>I rather suspect Mrs. GERTRUDE ATHERTON of having written <i>The
Avalanche</i> (MURRAY) either for the amusement of exercise in an
unfamiliar medium, or, well, for any motive that might explain a
production certainly not quite up to her own standard. Its
publishers (who may be prejudiced) consider <i>The Avalanche</i> as
"a brilliant and engaging study of mystery and romance;" me it
impressed as a melodrama dependent on one long-heralded sensation,
which proves on tardy arrival an affair of disappointment. I
suppose I must be careful not to give away the mystery, such as it
is. <i>Price Rugler</i> was anxious to discover why his attractive
wife assumed a worried look when money was mentioned and fainted on
being told that she was not to wear the family ruby at a particular
masque. All this happened (you may not be astonished to hear) in
San Francisco, amongst that luxurious, idle, over-moneyed society
whose manners Mrs. ATHERTON knows and describes so well.
<i>Price</i> had already found out, with the assistance of a not
too brilliant detective, that his wife's mother derived her income
from a gambling saloon; the remaining problem was how to link up
this knowledge with the odd behaviour of <i>Mrs. Price</i>. Perhaps
you see it already. She had been&mdash;No, I said I wouldn't, and I
won't. Of course the discovery couldn't be called cheerful, though
it was fortunately made in time to prevent any great harm. But it
was nothing like an avalanche.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is much harder, I am afraid, to be a good Bengali than a good
Englishman. <i>Nikhil</i>, the Rajah of Sir RABINDRANATH TAGORE'S
<i>The Home and the World</i> (MACMILLAN), persists in treating
<i>Sandip Babu</i> (a convinced Nietzchean in philosophy and a
Nationalist of the most inflammable type) as an honoured guest of
his household, in spite of the fact that he differs from the fellow
profoundly on every conceivable topic and is well aware, moreover,
that <i>Sandip</i> is rapidly winning the heart of his Rani,
<i>Bimala</i>. <i>Nikhil</i>, you see, considers that "all
imposition of force is weakness," and that "only the weak dare not
be just." Most Westerners, I think, would have kicked the
rhapsodical and rather plausible agitator out-of-doors and felt all
the better for it from the boot-toe upwards. The real truth is that
the story, which is written in the form of a triple autobiography
(<i>Nikhil, Sandip</i> and <i>Bimala</i> all taking a hand at
telling it in turn) is an exposition of two views of Suadeshi, or
what may be called the Sinn Fein movement in India. <i>Nikhil</i>
is the apostle of "self-realisation" as a moral force;
<i>Sandip</i> believes in grabbing whatever you can. The latter
first deifies his country (<i>Bande Mataram,</i> or "Hail, Mother!"
is the Nationalist motto) and then identifies <i>Bimala</i> with
the object of his worship, which seems a very convenient theory. As
for <i>Bimala</i>, she wavers between the two. The romantic
interest of the book (which is, by the way, a translation) breaks
down rather badly when it becomes clear that <i>Sandip</i> is not
really a big enough man to make a complete conquest of the Rani;
but from every other point of view it is supremely interesting. And
if <i>Nikhil</i> might perhaps have been improved by a little less
force of character and more of shoe-leather, <i>Bimala</i>, at any
rate, is a delightful personage.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Even "KATHARINE TYNAN" must sometimes fall below her own
standard, and <i>The Man from Australia</i> (COLLINS), though
written with considerable grace and charm, is too thin in plot to
be altogether satisfactory. <i>John Darling</i>, a youngish man of
wealth and an extremely liberal disposition, came from Australia to
visit his connexions in the West of Ireland and&mdash;if
opportunities occurred&mdash;to help them. Opportunities did offer
themselves in abundance. The <i>Adairs</i> in their various ways
were ripe for a benefactor of the <i>Darling</i> type to appear,
and <i>John</i> soon got busy. In the course of his
activities&mdash;for it would have been unkind (and very dull) to
bring him all the way from Australia to Ireland just to serve as a
travelling relief-fund&mdash;he is made to fall in love with one of
the <i>Adair</i> girls. And that's almost the whole story. One may
always trust Mrs. HINKSON to get her atmosphere right; but she is
not so happy in her attempt to contrast the preternaturally
unselfish <i>Darling</i> who, like an earlier <i>Mr. Darling</i>,
would have been content to live in a kennel) with the inordinately
self-indulgent father of the <i>Adairs</i>.</p>

<h2>THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS.</h2>
<p>"I assume," said the Cynic, "that you are sufficiently sanguine
to rejoice in the prospects of Peace."</p>
<p>"I derive a certain satisfaction from those prospects," replied
Mr. Punch on a note of reserve.</p>
<p>"But you ought to be jazzing for joy, like the other fools in
their Paradise of nigger minstrelsy."</p>
<p>"My years excuse me from choric exercises," said the Sage. "And,
anyhow, it doesn't take me that way."</p>
<p>"Then you are not in the movement. You are not in touch with the
spiritual pulse of our throbbing Metropolis; you take no active
part in the New Life that is springing from the seed of England's
sacrifices. True, your years, as you say, are against you, however
well you wear them: it is to the young that we look first for signs
of the great Regeneration. And in particular we look to those who
are to be the mothers of that future race which should reap the
full harvest of our blood and tears.</p>
<p>"And what do we find?" continued the Cynic. "We find a contempt
for the old virtues of simplicity and reticence; we find the
distinction of sex wiped out, and with it all reverence and sense
of mystery. Nature is a back number with them; they must for ever
be plastering their noses with powder&mdash;not just privily, as
used to be the better way of faded charmers, but shamelessly in
public places. In dress they barely keep within the bounds of
decency prescribed by the police. They make their own advances,
rounding up and capturing their 'boys' for partners, lest the
haunts of jazzery should be closed against them. And in this
competition for their favours the good modest fellows who only a
little while ago were fighting our battles for us are now giving
themselves the airs of spoilt beauties. What do you make of all
this in your scheme of Renaissance?"</p>
<p>"I admit much of what you say," said Mr. Punch, "but I ascribe
it, in part at least, to a natural reaction from the strain and
horror of War."</p>
<p>"'Reaction'!" snorted the Cynic. "A very comfortable word. But
what were the sufferings from which they are 'reacting'? The loss,
you will say, of the flower of our chivalry in battle? Well, one
would think that might have steadied them. Is this what our manhood
died for&mdash;to make a British carnival?"</p>
<p>"I don't pretend to understand that side of it," said the Sage,
"but I know that during the War we respected the silence of their
grief; and I know that nature must choose its own way of recovering
from a loss and reasserting its claim to happiness. Remember, too,
that War must always have its demoralising features, however
splendid the cause for which you are fighting. 'Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we die,' says the soldier in his brief
intervals of release. And some of us at home went more than
half-way to meet him, imitating an attitude excusable in him but
not in us. And that attitude is bound to survive for a little time
the causes that induced <span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id=
"page510"></a>[pg 510]</span> it. But you must not forget that many
of the type which you are now attacking did noble work in the War;
and they will do it again."</p>
<p>"That may be," said the Cynic; "but is it necessary to have an
orgy of <i>Carmagnole</i> in between?"</p>
<p>"I think perhaps it is like the case of a crew or a team going
out of training. They permit themselves a certain relaxation before
they start training for the next contest. But I think too that
there is something to be said for your reference to the
<i>Carmagnole</i>. We are passing through a phase of Revolution,
very natural after a great upheaval. The sense of freedom&mdash;the
very thing for which we have been fighting&mdash;is apt to turn the
heads of the young and thoughtless. There is a spirit of rebellion
in the air, which at its worst takes the form of Bolshevism, but
here is seen in a relatively harmless shape as a general revolt
against social restriction, a general passion for what is known as
'a good time.' In any case it is only a passing phase. Already
there are signs of a reaction from this reaction; of a return to
the decency of other days. They tell me, for a slight but
significant indication, that the waltz is coming back; that we may
even look to see a revival of the, minuet and pavane."</p>
<p>"Then it is just a question of a cycle of vogues? We are to be
swayed by recurring gusts of fashion, and not inspired by a fixed
ideal."</p>
<p>"Fashion counts with us, of course, for we are human and some of
us are feminine. There was a fashion of patriotism as there is now
a fashion of something that might easily be mistaken for its
opposite. But the range of its influence is largely confined to a
rather negligible element in London, the most provincial of
capitals. The Press&mdash;and notably the Photographic
Press&mdash;gives it a prominence out of all relation to its
importance. The great majority are untouched by it. They talk
little and they advertise less. But in a thousand quiet ways they
are setting themselves to make good."</p>
<p>"To make good money, you mean. Our world seems made up of
profiteers and of those who would be profiteers but can't, and so
abuse those who can. Can you name to me a period when there was a
wilder rush for wealth, or a more blatant display of luxury?
Sometimes I wish the War back; England was at her best when the
call for sacrifice came home to her. But how&mdash;we hear great
talk of Reconstruction, but I am reminded rather of the
Restoration."</p>
<p>"My friend," said the Sage, "I shall believe that this too is
only a temporary phase. Memory is not our strong point, but you can
perhaps throw back your mind to a year ago and recall how near we
came to the ruin of our hopes. Victory took us by surprise; and we
were less prepared for Peace at that moment than we ever had been
for War. And, just as in the first days of the fighting we went
astray, running after the cry, 'Business-as-usual,' so to-day we
are making as bad a mistake when we run after
'Pleasure-as-usual'&mdash;or rather more than usual. But we soon
revised that early error, and we shan't waste much time about
revising this. For though we lacked imagination then, and still
lack it, we have the gift, perhaps even more useful if less showy,
of common sense. And when common sense is found in natures that are
honest and hearts that are clean it may make mistakes, but not for
long.</p>
<p>"No, I am an optimist, and an incorrigible old fool, if you

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
